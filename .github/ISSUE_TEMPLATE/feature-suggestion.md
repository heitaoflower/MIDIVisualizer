Thank you for your interest in MIDIVisualizer, and thank you for helping me improve it! It is a personal project so I don't always have a lot of time to give to MIDIVisualizer, but I welcome all suggestions! 

Here you can describe any feature you would like to see in MIDIVisualizer. Feel free to add images or links to examples. You can also add a use case or explain why you think it would be an interesting addition. 

Don't hesitate to check the [issues](https://github.com/kosua20/MIDIVisualizer/issues) created by other people who might have suggested similar features. You can also check the [latest release](https://github.com/kosua20/MIDIVisualizer/releases/latest) from time to time to see the recently added features.

Thank you once again for your help!
